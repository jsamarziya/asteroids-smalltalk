In 1986 I wrote a program called <i>UFO Hangman</i>. The code was
written in Applesoft and ran on an Apple II at my high school; it had
a 12" green monochrome monitor. The game used text-based graphics, 40
columns by 24 rows, and was feeped with every creature I could think
of.  Among its bells, whistles, and gongs: It used a form of
double-buffering (the Apple II had two text screens that you could
switch between) to provide a quick "beam-up" effect: when you guessed
a letter that was in the word, the alien ship would beam up the letter
and place it in its correct place. The words that the aliens threw at
you were listed in files that could be changed or added to. And it
called machine-language routines (snarfed from some Beagle Brothers
code) to produce a few sounds (buzzing, mostly).

More than ten years after <i>UFO Hangman</i>, my first (and last)
game, I've implemented another: <i>Asteroids</i>, written in
Smalltalk.  It runs in the <a

href="http://www.parcplace.com/products/vworks/info/vw25.htm">VisualWorks</a>
environment, and on the P6-200 I developed it on, the game runs fairly
well.  It remains faithful to the original <i>Asteroids</i>
look-and-feel, as far as I can remember it.  Here's the <a
href="asteroids.st">source code</a> if you want to run it, and the <a
href="asteroids.html">formatted, human-readable source code</a> if you
want to read it.

My thoughts on Smalltalk after implementing <i>Asteroids</i>:

<p align=justify><spacer type=horizontal size=20>

In the past, I never tried to write a graphics-based game because I
didn't have easy-to-use graphics routines that I needed to draw to the
screen.  Implementing <i>Asteroids</i> was easy because of the large
set of graphics support classes that was available.  They allowed me
to schedule windows, draw graphical objects and stylized text, and use
double-buffering for flicker-free animation.  

<p align=justify><spacer type=horizontal size=20>

Besides the classes for graphics support, there were other premade
classes in the VisualWorks environment that made development easier.
When I needed to do keyboard handling, read and write files to disk,
store data in structures, or create multiple threads of execution, I
was able to find classes that allowed me to do it.  

<p align=justify><spacer type=horizontal size=20>

The downside of using the pre-existing classes was that it was
sometimes difficult to figure out how to use them.  There was not as
much documentation as I would have liked, although I was able to learn
much from examples.  The Blue Book was helpful in showing how control
structures work and in explaining how to fork processes, but it
couldn't help at all with platform-specific issues.  I never did
figure out how to manipulate text fonts, styles, and sizes, and in
general my string handling was not done very well.

<p align=justify><spacer type=horizontal size=20>

I found that using Smalltalk's inheritance-based classes worked well
to model the objects in the game.  I built a basic Sprite class which
defines an object that has a shape, velocity, acceleration, a location
in two-dimensional space, a rotational speed, and a color.  The
asteroids, the player's ship, the alien spaceships, and the explosion
particles were all modeled as subclasses of Sprite.  Much of the
behavior of those objects is the same for each, and so by putting the
code for those common behaviors in the Sprite class I avoided
replicating that code for each object.

<p align=justify><spacer type=horizontal size=20>

I was surprised to find how difficult it could be to debug Smalltalk
code. The most common errors occured after changing the definition of
instance variables of a class.  Often I would decide to remove or
rename an instance variable, which would then cause to break those
instance methods that referenced the variable.  I soon learned to find
and correct all methods that referenced a variable before making such
changes.  

<p align=justify><spacer type=horizontal size=20>

In the beginning stages of design, it was difficult to keep track of
what types I intended for all the different variables.  The lack of
type declarations made things confusing early on, and adding comments
didn't help -- when my intentions changed, the comments usually didn't
keep up. As the design became more concrete and familiar, there was
not such a problem.

<p align=justify><spacer type=horizontal size=20>

The lack of compile-time type checking seemed to make program
validation more difficult than usual.  I found it sometimes difficult,
after making changes to the code, to test whether the changes had
introduced bugs into the program. "Message not understood" errors
would occur at odd times, and it was difficult to tell whether one was
still out there, waiting to occur.  Testing a program is hardly ever
easy, but the absence of up-front type checking added to the list of
potential bugs that had to be sought out.

<p align=justify><spacer type=horizontal size=20>

It was very useful to be able to tune while the program was running
the parameters that determine the physical behavior of game objects.
Changes could be made to timing and scaling values while the program
was active, and because Smalltalk is interpreted the effects of those
changes would be seen immediately.  Getting the ships and asteroids to
move and collide and rotate <i>just right</i> was pretty easy to do.

<p align=justify><spacer type=horizontal size=20>

The downside of this flexibility, of course, is poor execution speed.
On the Pentium Pro 200 MHz machine on which it was developed,
<i>Asteroids</i> can maintain a frame rate varying between 8 and 13
frames per second.  The high end of this range provides acceptable
playability but at the lower frame rates the performance deterioration
is obvious, and everything comes to a momentary halt whenever the
garbage collector runs.  

<p align=justify><spacer type=horizontal size=20>

I have optimized the code where I could, by replacing expensive
collection data structures with linked lists, for example, and by
reusing shape objects.  There may be other was to make the game run
more efficiently, but I have so far been unable to find them.
